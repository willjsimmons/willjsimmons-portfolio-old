 one cannot begin to discuss javascript without presenting a comparison to other popular programing languages.
Loose Typing.
    the primary difference between javascript and c++ or java is how each language represents and interacts with data.
    Languages such as c++ adopt an Object Oriented aproach to programming and is therefore considered an object oriented language.
        Encapsulation
        polymorphisim.
        inheritance
        abstraction
    Although javascript does include the concept of objects and employs many oop principals it is typicaly considered a functional language.
So why use javascript
        Now days javascript has is used for more than just your traditional front end web application language.
        With libraries such as node js.
        Due to loose typing javascript primitives are polymorphic by nature.
    due to loose typing and simple syntax javascript is realatively Easy to learn and use.
Why choose another language.
    in terms of performance languages such as c and c++ typicaly offer beter results.
    as these languages are typicaly compiled as opposed to interpreted.
    
If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? 
Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?
Benefits and drawbacks.
