 In order to begin to discuss the qualities of javascript a comparison to other popular programing languages.
 the primary difference between javascript and c++ or java is how each language represents and interacts with data.
 Languages such as c++ adopt an Object Oriented aproach to programming and is therefore considered an object oriented language.
 
 *Encapsulation
 *polymorphisim
 *inheritance
 *abstraction
 
Although javascript does include the concept of objects and employs many oop principals it is typicaly considered a functional language.
In addition to this javascript is a loosely typed language and unlike most languages does not require datatype specification on initialization.
this makes javascript alot easier to use particularly for beginner developers and allows for some interesting behavioral characteristics.
In javascript it is quite common that functions return other functions. In languages like java this can be difficult to do without instanciating an object , returning that object 
    
## why use javascript

Modern javascript has a wide range of nontraditional applications. Although javascript is most commonly known for its use as a front end language modern frameworks such as node js. have allowed javascript to be used serverside aswell.
on the front end alone javascript allows developers to leverage powerfull libraries Such as Jquery, angular js, and react to create stunning graphics. Tools like ajax allow for asynchronus server communication, and facilitate page updates without refreshing the entire page.
due to loose typing and simple syntax javascript is realatively Easy to learn and use.

## Why choose another language.
 
in terms of performance languages such as c and c++ typicaly offer beter performance results,
as these languages are typicaly compiled directly to assemply as opposed to interpreted.
In addition programs written in other languages may have more cross platform compatability. programs written in java for example  are
available on any machine with a jvm.
Although in modern browsers javascript is supported more often than not, it is not unheardof to lack support for newer features, or the language entirely in certain legacy browsers. 

## Javascript and Athletic programming

javascripts unique feature set and ease of use make it perfectly suitable for Athletic Programming.
By its simplest definition athletic programming can best be described as programming under either time constraint or competitively.
javascript provides a perfect platform for programatic expression without the overwhelming pitfalls that verbose syntax poses for other languages.
