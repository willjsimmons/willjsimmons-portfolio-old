 One cannot begin to discuss the qualities of javascript without presenting a comparison to other popular programing languages.
 the primary difference between javascript and c++ or java is how each language represents and interacts with data.
 Languages such as c++ adopt an Object Oriented aproach to programming and is therefore considered an object oriented language.
 
 *Encapsulation
 *polymorphisim
 *inheritance
 *abstraction
 
Although javascript does include the concept of objects and employs many oop principals it is typicaly considered a functional language.In addition to this javascript is a loosely typed language and does not require datatype specification on initialization.
this makes javascript alot easier to use particularly for beginner developers. 
    
## why use javascript

Modern javascript has a wide range of nontraditional applications. Although javascript is most commonly known for its use as a front end language modern frameworks such as node js.
on the front end alone javascript allows developers to leverage powerfull libraries Such as Jquery, angular js, and react to name a few.  
due to loose typing and simple syntax javascript is realatively Easy to learn and use.
Loose Typing.
    
## Why choose another language.
 
in terms of performance languages such as c and c++ typicaly offer beter results.
as these languages are typicaly compiled as opposed to interpreted.

## Javascript and Athletic programming

javascripts unique feature set and ease of use make it perfectly suitable for Athletic Programming
javascripts simple syntax preventss syntactic discrepencies from making a huge operational programming.
