GAme engine vl, Spring 2015. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site. 

Game Engine v2 is a work in progress project created to explore modern graphics and shader programing pipelines.
It 
Rendering engine which I am currently in the process of reimplementing from in the more robust vulkan graphics api.

Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
